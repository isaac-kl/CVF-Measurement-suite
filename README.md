Code developed to run IEC CV measurement equipment using Hioki IM3536 LCR, Kiethley 2400 SMU, Kiethley XXXX Multimeter. Code can be changed to run with other equiment with small changes.

This code is developed to have customizible scan rates, directions, delays, and prebiasing to work in material systems with significant hysteresis such as perovskites.

All code references CVCommands.py

All code written by Isaac K. Lam and Austin G. Kuba at IEC, University of Delaware.
